# Social Network API

## Description

The Social Network API is an application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It utilizes a MongoDB database to house the differently structured data needed to keep a social network app working smoothly. The app is built by using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Installation

Be sure to have MongoDB installed on your machine. You also need an application to make API calls (GET, DELETE, POST, PUSH) such as Postman or Insomia.
